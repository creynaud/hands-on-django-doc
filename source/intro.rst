Hands on Django: what we are going to do
========================================

This is the Django website we want to implement: https://django-notes.herokuapp.com/

It is a simple note taking web app, that let's you create, edit, delete and read notes.
A note has a title, a content, a date and an owner.

The source code is available on github: https://github.com/creynaud/hands-on-django

The django-notes.herokuapp.com instance runs on Heroku, in the Europe area.

The full Django documentation can be found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/.
