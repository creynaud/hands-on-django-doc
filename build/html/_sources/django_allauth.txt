Authentication with django allauth
==================================

Django allauth let's you implement local or social authentication for your Django website.
It provides views that will typically reside under /accounts, e.g /accounts/login/, /accounts/logout. Follow the installation guide: http://django-allauth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

For the settings which are not yet in your settings.py, look at the default values in Django's settings reference documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/.

You will also need an email backend, so add the following setting too:

.. code-block:: python

    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'

This will log the allauth emails (for email verification, reset password...) to the console.

It would be nice to:

* be redirected to the 'my notes' page after logging in (instead of /accounts/profile/)
* require the user to enter an email on signup
* make email verification mandatory

You can also add a tool that can be helpful when debugging: the Django Debug Toolbar.

.. code-block:: bash

    (hands-on-django)pony@Pony-VirtualBox:~/hands-on-django$ pip install django-debug-toolbar

Also add the following code in your project's settings.py

.. code-block:: python

    if DEBUG:
        INSTALLED_APPS += (
            'debug_toolbar',
        )

Refresh http://127.0.0.1:8000/, you should now see the debug toolbar on the right hand side. Click on templates or SQL for example to see which debug information it can provide.

Donâ€™t forget to commit your changes before going to the next step.
